# Master's Thesis: Dialectal TTS for Norwegian

This repository contains the code, data preparation scripts, and analysis notebooks used in my master's thesis on synthesizing Norwegian dialects using text-to-speech (TTS) systems.

The forked repo's have changes in them where I have followed their tutorial on how to train models based on my own dataset.


## Preprocessing Scripts

All Python scripts in the `data_preprocessing/` folder are used for preparing and cleaning the dataset before training. These include:

- `change_sample_rate.py`: Resample audio to desired sample rate (22 050Hz).
- `check_sample_rate.py`: Check sample rates across audio files to see if they all have the same.
- `clean_data.py`: Clean and normalize transcription text.
- `combine_training_data.py`: Merge datasets for training.
- `create_data_for_matcha.py`: Format data for Matcha-TTS.
- `find_n_speakers.py`: Get speaker counts per dialect/region.
- `get_length.py`: Calculate audio lengths.
- `get_length_syntesized.py`: Calculate length of synthesized audio.

Each script is standalone and can be run as needed.

## TTS Training

This project uses two TTS models:

- [**IMS-Toucan**](https://github.com/victorialangoe/IMS-Toucan)
- [**Matcha-TTS**](https://github.com/victorialangoe/Matcha-TTS)

These are forked repositories where I added my own data and modified the configuration files. Please refer to the respective README files in those repos for training instructions used for this thesis.

## Analysis

### `survey_analysis.ipynb`

Contains the **quantitative evaluation** from a listening study where participants rated speech samples on:

- Authenticity
- Naturalness
- Intelligibility

The notebook also includes graphs and statistical summaries.

### `qualitative_analysis.ipynb`

Contains **qualitative feedback analysis** from open-ended survey questions. Thematic patterns and listener comments are analyzed and summarized.

## Synthesized Audio

The `synthesized_sentences/` folder includes audio samples generated by the models. These were used in the listening study and reflect the output quality across dialects.
